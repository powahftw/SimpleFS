# SimpleFS - A small simple virtual FileSystem
Coded as the final assignment of the API (Principles of Algorithm Design). SimpleFS is a virtual hierarchic filesystem that simulate some of the basic functions of a real file system. 


### Purpose

It is able to keep track of files and folders and support various functions. It work by reading a command-journal from stdin and return on the stdout the outcome of the operations.

It operate under asymptotic time and memory complexity limits imposed by the challenge.

The project in implemented in C99 with only the standard library (libc) and the base runtime.
